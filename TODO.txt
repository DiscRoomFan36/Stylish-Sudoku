USEABILITY:
    - some way to load different sudoku's (maybe store them in a folder and have a file brower)

    - add other formes of marking. like renban line (aka just lines.)

    - add a pallet of things you can do (like sudokupad, that allowes better picking of colors)

    - there are still (still) some animations that are not done and have a placeholder... (the fade out's, but thats beyond the scope, i feel like it would be 100x harder to get all of them without a general algorithm.)



SOUND:
    - sound for placeing digit
    - sound for marking
    - sound for deleation
    - sound for undo/redo

    - sound for selection?



SOLVER:
    - start the solver





DONE:
    - pick better colors for everything
    - there are still some animations that are not done and have a placeholder... (but its fine for now, would have to try much harder to get all the edge cases, i feel like theres some grafics programmer out there laughing at my code. I will find you.)
    - animate the selection process.
