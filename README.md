# Stylish Sudoku

A simple stylish sudoku player.

*TODO: a small gif of the player, placing some digits, making big selections, and using the double click feature.*


## Quick Start

```bash
# compile the build script once.
$ cc -o nob nob.c

# compile and run
$ ./nob && ./build/main_debug
```

## Featuring...

### Cool Selection Animations!

*TODO gif of cool selections animations, maybe 4 at once, do some editing*

### Sudoku Logic!

This helpfully shows when you incorrectly placed a digit

*TODO gif of this happening*

### Auto Saves && Undo/Redo

a standard feature

*NOTE: web version dose not know about local storage yet, and cannot save. TODO do that*


### Sounds!

Trust me on this one.

*TODO actually implement sounds*


### A Web Version!

Currently buggy as all hell. (the mouse doesn't work among other things)

*TODO maybe put an image here?*
